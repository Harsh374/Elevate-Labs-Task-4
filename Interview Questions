1. How does logistic regression differ from linear regression?
Linear regression predicts a continuous value.
Logistic regression predicts the probability of a binary class using the sigmoid function.
Logistic regression outputs values between 0 and 1 and uses a threshold (like 0.5) to classify.

2. What is the sigmoid function?
The sigmoid function is:
                 σ(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-x))
It maps any real number to a value between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as a probability.
In logistic regression, it transforms the linear output into a probability of belonging to class 1.

3. What is precision vs recall?
Precision = TP / (TP + FP): Of all predicted positives, how many were actually positive?
Recall = TP / (TP + FN): Of all actual positives, how many were correctly predicted?
Precision is about quality of positives, recall is about coverage of actual positives.

4. What is the ROC-AUC curve?
ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) plots True Positive Rate (Recall) vs False Positive Rate.
AUC (Area Under the Curve) is a single number summarizing the model’s ability to distinguish between classes.
AUC = 1 is perfect, AUC = 0.5 is no better than random guessing.

5. What is the confusion matrix?
A 2x2 table showing:
                            Predicted Positive	     Predicted Negative
Actual Positive           	True Positive (TP)	    False Negative (FN)
Actual Negative	            False Positive (FP)   	True Negative (TN)

It helps visualize the types of prediction errors.

6. What happens if classes are imbalanced?
The model may be biased toward the majority class.
Accuracy becomes misleading.
You should use precision, recall, F1-score, or ROC-AUC, and consider resampling techniques (like SMOTE or undersampling).

7. How do you choose the threshold?
By default, it's 0.5, but you can adjust it based on:
Business need (e.g., prioritize recall in cancer detection).
Trade-off between precision and recall.
Use plots like Precision-Recall vs Threshold or ROC Curve to guide the choice.

8. Can logistic regression be used for multi-class problems?
Yes. Though originally binary, logistic regression can handle multi-class classification using strategies like:
One-vs-Rest (OvR) – default in scikit-learn.
Multinomial Logistic Regression – with softmax instead of sigmoid.
